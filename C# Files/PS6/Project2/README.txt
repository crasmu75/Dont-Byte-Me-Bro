I had so much trouble trying to figure out coded UI tests. I eventually deleted them all because they wouldn't pass. When I recorded the events I would see everything how it shoudl be,
and the assertion part of the test would recognize the values, but when I would run the tests the cells wouldn't  ever be entered. I think it had something to do with the formula changing the value
of the string being displayed in the contents box. I could not figure this out. So I deleted all the tests I recorded and tried to make new ones but it never worked.

Should I store the value in the cell and modify it each time a change is made to the spreadsheet? Or reevaluate every time the getValue function is called?
Should changed be 'true' if the spreadsheet failed to modify due to circular dependency?
Should I import entire spreadsheet from saved file before evaluating each content to determine value? Even though when we change a cell we update value immediately?
